# Configuration

How a running Hatch install stores state, picks an agent, and can be tuned.

## Where state lives

The packaged app keeps everything mutable under `~/.hatch`: extensions, the local SQLite database, caches, agent sessions, the custom agent catalog, and preferences.
Upgrades preserve this directory, so generated widgets and extension state survive.

On launch, packaged Hatch refreshes bundled defaults (`AGENTS.md`, `hatch-env.d.ts`, recipes, starter extensions) from the app template while leaving your own extension directories untouched.
If `~/.hatch/extensions` is a symlink, Hatch resolves it for seeding and packaged widget/layout CSS compilation, which supports managed symlinks into writable dotfiles directories such as home-manager `mkOutOfStoreSymlink`.
Read-only or otherwise invalid targets are skipped with a log message instead of blocking startup.

## Choosing an agent

Hatch detects supported agents in order: Claude Code (`claude`), then Codex (`codex`).
Both run through bundled clean-room ACP adapters that drive the authenticated local CLI without inheriting user-level settings, skills, MCP servers, or extra rules.

| Mechanism | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Settings | Persist an agent choice across launches; add, edit, or remove custom agents. |
| `HATCH_AGENT=<name>` | Override auto-detection before a preference is saved. |
| `agents.json` | Override or append catalog entries manually. |

If a send fails, the popover shows bounded, actionable guidance instead of raw provider diagnostics or a generic unavailable hint.
For built-in agents, authentication failures prompt you to run `codex login` or launch `claude` and complete sign-in before trying again.
If the failed turn edited files before stopping, Hatch keeps those partial changes available for Keep or Undo; a failed turn with no file changes closes cleanly.

### Codex model exception

The Codex adapter reads only the top-level `model` from `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` or `~/.codex/config.toml` and passes it as `--model`, because it otherwise runs Codex with `--ignore-user-config`.

## Custom ACP agents

Add agents from Settings (id, optional label, ACP launch command) or by editing `agents.json` directly.
Packaged mode reads `~/.hatch/agents.json`; source mode reads `agents.json` at the repo root.
Settings-added agents are editable and removable; built-in Claude Code and Codex stay read-only.

Each entry is an object with `name`, optional `label`, `command`, `installHint`, and `launchCommand`.
Entries with `launchCommand` register as custom [`acpx`](https://github.com/openclaw/acpx) overrides and show as available.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "pi",
    "label": "Pi",
    "launchCommand": "npx pi-acp"
  }
]
```

`launchCommand` is any Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server command.
The underlying CLI must be installed and authenticated.
Examples:

| Agent | `launchCommand` |
| --- | --- |
| Pi | `npx pi-acp` |
| Cursor | `cursor-agent acp` |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot --acp --stdio` |
| Qwen Code | `qwen --acp` |
| OpenCode | `npx -y opencode-ai acp` |

## Updates

Update with Homebrew:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade --cask hatch
```

When a newer GitHub Release exists, Hatch shows an indicator in the popover header that opens a dialog with the same command and a link to the release notes.
If Hatch is running during a Cask upgrade, the cask quits the old app and relaunches the new one after replacement.
Fresh installs and upgrades while Hatch is closed do not launch the app automatically.

## Telemetry

Packaged release builds send anonymous, best-effort usage telemetry to a self-hosted Umami instance.

- **Records:** app startup, popover opens (`/popover` page views plus named events), agent turn outcomes, agent switches.
- **Never includes:** user/device id, prompts, file contents, generated code, extension data, or local paths.
- Network failures are ignored.

Set `HATCH_TELEMETRY=0` in the launch environment to opt out.

| `HATCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR=<dir>`  | Overrides the active extension workspace in source/dev runs. Dev Tailwind scans only `extensions/` and `extensions-dev/`, so overrides outside those paths need matching `@source` coverage for widget utilities. |
| `CODEX_HOME=<dir>`                | When Codex is the selected built-in agent, points the adapter at `<dir>/config.toml` for the top-level `model`; other Codex user config is still ignored.                                                         |
| `HATCH_TELEMETRY=0`           | Disables packaged-release telemetry; `false` and `off` are also accepted                                                                                                                                          |
| `HATCH_UMAMI_HOST=<url>`      | Overrides the self-hosted Umami endpoint used by telemetry. Source/dev/test builds are no-op unless a website id is also configured.                                                                               |
| `HATCH_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=<id>` | Overrides or supplies the Umami website id used by telemetry. The release workflow reads this from the GitHub Actions `vars.*` context, not a secret.                                                             |
