# Popup menu — UI kit

A clickable recreation of the redesigned Hatch tray popover in the Monochrome Lab direction.

## Files

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Loads React + Babel and mounts the prototype. |
| `popup.css` | All layout + component CSS for the kit. Imports tokens from `../../colors_and_type.css`. |
| `MenuBar.jsx` | Fake macOS menu bar with the tray button. |
| `App.jsx` | Top-level shell. Owns popover open state, widgets, the active Run, and the session. |
| `Composer.jsx` | Slim 1-line prompt with `›` prefix, blinking caret, auto-grow on multi-line typing. Pinned on the main idle surface; replaced by `RunStrip` during a run and hidden in settings. |
| `RunStrip.jsx` | Single live affordance — pulsing mint dot, agent's task + current step, elapsed timer. No log history. |
| `SessionBar.jsx` | Human-language summary from the workspace diff (`Added the cpu extension`, `Updated the layout`) with **Keep** / **Undo** actions. |
| `WidgetHost.jsx` | Prototype widget shell + three sample widgets (claude · weekly, battery, now playing). The live host no longer renders a generic per-widget manual refresh button; the app header owns the reload-layout control. |

## Interactions to try

1. **Click the `b` tray icon** in the menu bar (top right). The popover toggles.
2. **Type a request** in the composer and press Enter (or click `send`). The composer flips into a `RunStrip` with a pulsing mint dot, a current-step subtitle that fades up each time the agent advances, and a live timer. No checklist, no log.
3. **When the agent finishes with file changes**, a `SessionBar` slides in with a plain-language diff summary (e.g. `Added the cpu extension`) and two buttons: **Keep** and **Undo**. Click **Keep** to clear the bar and keep the change; click **Undo** to discard it.
4. **Send a second request while a session is still pending** — the SessionBar flips to an amber-dot `Finish this change first` state. Click **Dismiss** and try again.
5. **Use the header controls** in the live app to reload the layout, install an available update, open settings, or fully quit Hatch.
   Reloading remounts the menu surface and resets widget React state without clearing the agent conversation.
   The settings view replaces the menu body and hides the composer until you return to the main surface; this prototype documents that flow but does not implement the settings screen.
   The live settings screen shows unavailable agents disabled with install hints and confirms before switching agents because switching resets the current conversation.

## What this kit *does not* try to do

- It does not call the real agent. Steps and summaries are mocked.
- It does not execute git commands. **Keep** / **Undo** flip UI state only and never expose commits or file paths.

## Compatibility with the live codebase

| Live file | Kit equivalent | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `App.tsx` | `App.jsx` | The mode toggle is gone; the live app has reload layout, update, settings, and quit controls in the header, and the composer is hidden while settings are open. |
| `agent/AgentChat.tsx` | `Composer.jsx` + `RunStrip.jsx` + `SessionBar.jsx` | Three components from one chat surface. There is no message history. |
| `menu/MenuSurface.tsx` + `menu/WidgetHost.tsx` | `WidgetHost.jsx` | Recipes pill row removed — recipes are an agent-side concept, not user UI. |
| `styles.css` | `popup.css` + `colors_and_type.css` | |

`AgentChatMessage[]` from `src/shared/contracts.ts` is not used in this design - there is no transcript. The live `AgentChatResult` returns `assistantText` plus an optional `GitSessionSnapshot`; `useAgentRuntime` derives the SessionBar notice from `changes`, `dirty`, `canSave`, and `canRollback`, not from agent text. Git-shaped fields such as `head` and `commit` are never rendered.
