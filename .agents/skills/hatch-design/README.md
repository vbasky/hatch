# Hatch Design System

A design system for **Hatch** — a macOS tray-bar app that lives behind a system menu-bar icon. Click the tray icon and a small dark popover falls from the menu bar. Inside the popover, an embedded agent can edit the active extension workspace at runtime to add widgets, and the user can interact with those widgets without ever leaving the menu surface.

The visual direction is **Monochrome Lab** — terminal-elegant, near-black, mono type, one mint signal color. The popover should read as a calm command-line surface that happens to live in the macOS menu bar.

---

## What Hatch is

Hatch is a tray-popover OS-level utility built around a single moving surface: the user looks at and uses the widgets the agent has built, and the agent is one slim prompt away at the bottom of the main menu. There is no build-mode toggle, no separate "build" view, no chat panel. The composer is *the* affordance for talking to the agent in the main surface, and it sits there when idle - a single line of mono type with a `›` prompt prefix. The exceptions are the settings view, which replaces the body and composer while open, and an in-flight agent run, where the RunStrip replaces the composer until the run finishes.

When the user sends a request, the composer momentarily becomes a `RunStrip`: a single live affordance with a pulsing mint dot, the agent's current step, and an elapsed timer. **No log, no step history.** When the agent finishes with real file changes, a `SessionBar` slides in with a plain-language summary derived from the workspace diff (`Added the cpu extension`, `Updated the layout`) and two buttons: **Keep** and **Undo**. The user never sees commit SHAs, file counts, or the word "git" - those are infrastructure they shouldn't have to think about.

The popover surface is adaptive: 504px wide by default, wider when a root `layout.tsx` owns a custom canvas, and dynamic-height within the host limits.
On the main menu, the composer is pinned to the bottom; everything above it stacks and grows.
The header keeps compact reload-layout, update, settings, and quit controls together; the update control appears only when a newer release is available, while quit stays neutral at rest and shifts to danger coral only on hover.
Reloading the layout remounts the menu surface and resets widget React state without clearing the agent conversation.
Settings replaces the menu body and composer, and includes both the `open at login` preference and the embedded-agent picker.
Agent options are radio-like rows: available inactive agents can be selected, unavailable agents are disabled with install hints, and switching agents requires confirmation because it resets the current conversation.

## Source material

This system was built from the live codebase at:

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/vbasky/hatch (`main`)

Key files referenced (paths in that repo):

- `AGENTS.md` — architecture, three-process split, source-vs-packaged change-session invariants, recipe conventions.
- `src/renderer/styles.css` — the live Monochrome Lab popover shell and app-surface styling.
- `src/renderer/App.tsx`, `src/renderer/UpdateIndicator.tsx`, `src/renderer/agent/AgentChat.tsx`, `src/renderer/menu/MenuSurface.tsx`, `src/renderer/menu/WidgetHost.tsx` — the components being redesigned here.
- `src/ui/` — the shared `@hatch/ui` component kit used by the app shell and extension widgets.
- `src/ui/theme.css` — the Tailwind `@theme` token source consumed by the renderer and per-widget CSS compiler.
- `src/shared/ui-exports.ts` — the public export contract for the host-provided design-system surface.
- `src/shared/contracts.ts` — `HatchWidget`, `RefreshableHatchWidget`, `GitSessionSnapshot`, `AgentChatResult` — the data contracts our redesign remains compatible with.
- `extensions/hello-world/widget.tsx` — the first-run greeting widget and starter example of widget shape.
- `extensions/recipes/*.html` — daisyUI/Tailwind "wireframe" recipe docs. Note: recipes use a separate visual system and should not bleed into popover designs.

## Content fundamentals

Hatch copy is **terse, lowercase, second-person, present-tense**. It sounds like log output a careful engineer would write — not marketing, not chat. The wordmark is `baby_menu` (lowercase, underscore separator) so it reads like an identifier.

### Voice rules

- **Lowercase by default.** UI strings stay lowercase unless they're a proper noun, an identifier, or a button label (which is sentence-case-with-no-period). The wordmark is `baby_menu`.
- **Tracked-caps for keys.** Anything that classifies - widget key (`CLAUDE · WEEKLY`), source (`OAUTH`, `CLI`, `WEB`, `MOCK`), occasional status word - is rendered uppercase with `0.18em` letter-spacing at 11px minimum. This is the workhorse heading of the entire system.
- **Address the user as "you"; address the agent as "the agent"** (never "I", "we", or "Claude").
- **No emoji.** Status is a small glowing mint dot + one tracked-caps word. Live UI dots are 6px in shared components and 8px in RunStrip/SessionBar controls. Never `🟢` or `✅`.
- **Use ASCII glyphs as iconography.** `›` for prompt, `+` for add, `·` for separator, `↵` `⌘` for shortcuts. Lucide is used when an ASCII glyph won't read, including compact update, refresh, settings, and quit controls.
- **Plain dashes, not em dashes.** (From `AGENTS.md`. Honor it in copy.)
- **Numbers are confident, units are quiet.** `72%` is 32px / weight 300; `last sync 12:04` is 11px / 48% ink.

### Tone

The personality is "competent log". A calm CLI tool that happens to have a face. Not chirpy, not formal, never apologetic.

**Yes:**

- `Added the cpu extension`
- `keep it, or undo`
- `Finish this change first`
- `talk to hatch`
- `last sync 12:04`
- `claude · weekly`
- `designing the widget`
- `wiring it into your menu`

**No:**

- `🎉 Awesome — your widget is ready!`
- `Hi! I'm hatch.`
- `Pending session: 3 files in extensions/cpu-temp/`
- `git change session committed · b8d3a2c`
- `Oh no, something went wrong. Please try again.`
- `Click the button below to begin.`

### Capitalization & punctuation

- Wordmark: `baby_menu` (lowercase, underscore).
- Module / widget keys: ALL CAPS, tracked `0.18em`. `CLAUDE · WEEKLY`, `CPU`, `NOW PLAYING`.
- Button labels: Sentence case, no period. `Keep`, `Undo`, `Dismiss`. Special-case: tiny labels like `send` stay lowercase as a typographic detail (it reads as a command, not a button).
- Placeholders: lowercase imperative, no period, no `...` ellipsis. `talk to hatch`.
- Error states: declarative, no exclamation. `Finish this change first.` `Refresh timed out.`
- The word "agent" stays lowercase except at the start of a sentence.

### Agent-facing copy

When the agent narrates its work, it speaks in plain language - never paths, never file counts, never SHAs, never the word "git".
The RunStrip title is the user's prompt, and its subtitle comes only from assistant response text.
Until assistant response text is available, the subtitle reads `Working...`.
Do not surface tool names, usage updates, command names, or synthetic progress labels in the RunStrip subtitle.
When assistant response text appears there, it should be plain user-facing copy:

- `Built the Claude quota widget`
- `Added the calendar widget`

When the agent finishes with real file changes, the SessionBar summarizes the diff in one phrase, past-tense:

- `Added the cpu extension`
- `Updated the now-playing extension`
- `Updated the layout`

If the agent made no on-disk change, the UI should say that plainly instead of showing Keep / Undo.
The user should be able to read a real-change summary and immediately know whether to **Keep** it or **Undo** it without thinking about engineering at all.

## Visual foundations

Everything in the system aims for one feeling: **a calm command-line surface that happens to live in the macOS menu bar.** Not a web app, not a chat, not a dashboard.

### Color

The palette is **near-black + white-at-alpha + one mint signal**. Inspect `src/ui/theme.css` for the live Tailwind token source and `colors_and_type.css` for prototype/app-shell CSS tokens.

- **Background** is layered near-black: `--bg-void` `#060607` (outside the popover), `--bg-stage` `#0B0B0C` (popover canvas), `--bg-surface` `#101012` (modules in preview cards), `--bg-elevated` `#16161A` (composer field, hover). **Never use `#000` directly** — pure black reads as missing pixels against the macOS desktop.
- **Ink** is white at progressively lower alpha — `0.96 / 0.86 / 0.65 / 0.48 / 0.34 / 0.22 / 0.12 / 0.07`. The alpha is part of the system; never write `color: #FFF` directly. Use `rgba(255,255,255,…)` or the `--ink-*` tokens.
- **Signal — mint** (`--signal-live` `#6AE3B6`) is the *only* accent. Used as a 5–8px dot with a soft glow, as a single tracked-caps word, or as a 1px progress fill. Never as a button fill, never as a background of more than 10% alpha. This restraint is the entire point.
- **Warning** is amber and **danger** is coral. Production Tailwind uses `--color-signal-warn` / `text-signal-warn` and `--color-signal-danger` / `text-signal-danger`; prototype/app-shell CSS also exposes `--signal-pending` and `--signal-error`.
  Both follow the same rules as mint - dot + word, never a fill.
- **No blue, no purple, no orange.** A "second accent" would weaken the system. If a status needs more weight than mint, use a louder mint dot, not a different color.

### Typography

- **Mono** — `JetBrains Mono`, 300 / 400 / 500 / 600. Used for *everything* in the popover surface — body, labels, values, buttons, error messages. Weight 300 is reserved for big numbers; 400 for body; 500 for buttons and titles.
- **Prose** — `Inter Tight`, 300 / 400 / 500. Used ONLY in long-form explanatory copy (e.g. this README, preview-card notes). Never inside the popover surface itself. Opt in via `.prose`.

Scale stays compact but readable: `--fs-xxs` / `text-xxs` **11px**, `xs` **12px**, `sm` **13px**, `base` **14px**, `md` **16px**, with hero values **28–36px**. Tabular numerals are on by default (`font-feature-settings: "tnum"`) so columns of values align. The app-shell CSS still uses a few 10px legacy meta treatments for dense widget keys, foot rows, run timers, and SessionBar hints; do not use those as the default widget type scale.

### Spacing

The app-shell and prototype token files use a 2px base scale: `2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32`.
Widget authors using the shared Tailwind path should use normal Tailwind spacing utilities with the Hatch color and type tokens, not custom `--space-*` values.
The popover lives on a 12–14px outer padding.
Widgets are separated by `1px dashed` dividers, not gutters, so the surface reads as a continuous log rather than separate cards.

### Background

The popover background is solid `--bg-stage` `#0B0B0C`. No gradients. No textures. No patterns. The macOS desktop behind it provides the only depth. The popover-positioner has no arrow / pointer — it just falls below the tray button.

There are no background images, no full-bleed photography, no illustrations. Imagery is reserved for widget data (e.g. an album-art square in `Now playing`). Chrome is *type and color only*.

### Borders, radius, dividers

- **Outer popover** radius: **10px** (`--radius-xl`). Sharper than most macOS native windows - this is intentional terminal posture.
- **Modules / cards** inside preview surfaces: **8px** (`--radius-lg`).
- **Inputs**: **4px** (`--radius-sm`).
- **Buttons**: shared production buttons use compact `--radius-sm` corners. Prototype/app-shell pill controls are allowed for tight terminal affordances, but do not assume pill shape for `@hatch/ui` buttons.
- **Borders** are 1px white at low alpha (`--line` `12%`, `--line-faint` `7%`). Inside the popover, the only borders are the outer 1px and the divider between head/body/composer.
- **Dividers** between widgets: `1px dashed --line-faint`. Between popover sections (head, body, composer): `1px solid --line`. The shift from solid to dashed signals "infrastructure" vs "content".

### Shadows

Exactly one shadow: `--shadow-pop` — `0 24px 80px rgba(0,0,0,0.65)` plus a 0.5px white inner edge. Cast by the popover onto the desktop. **No card shadows anywhere else.** Inside the popover, depth is implied by alpha and dividers, not by elevation.

### Transparency & blur

The macOS popover assumes the OS provides its own under-window blur. Inside the popover we use solid `--bg-stage` and rely on alpha on text for hierarchy — *no* `backdrop-filter` on inner elements. The menu bar above uses a 20px backdrop blur at 82% black, the standard macOS Sonoma vibrancy posture.

### Animation

Motion is **snappy, short, and ease-out.**

- `--motion-fast` **80ms** — hover, compact-control color shift, dot pulse start.
- `--motion-base` **160ms** — segmented-control toggle, button press, focus ring fade.
- `--motion-slow` **280ms** — popover entry/exit (translate + scale), RunStrip appear, progress fill changes.
- **Caret blink**: 1100ms `steps(2, start)` — the composer caret blinks like a real terminal cursor.
- **Active-step pulse**: 1400ms `ease-in-out` infinite, opacity 1 ↔ 0.4 on the active step's mint dot.

Easings: `--ease` `cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)` for entry; `--ease-in-out` for things that morph in place.

**No bounces.** No springs. No skeuomorphic 3D rotations. A terminal does not boing.

### Interaction states

- **Hover** on text-button: background fades to `--bg-elevated`, border to `--ink-600`, text to `--ink-100` over 160ms.
- **Hover** on compact icon controls or text-link affordances: color shifts to `--signal-live`.
- **Hover** on quit: keep the button neutral at rest, then shift icon/text to `--signal-error` / `text-signal-danger` on hover without using a danger fill.
- **Press** (`:active`): background drops to `--bg-pressed`. No translate, no shrink — keep the surface still.
- **Focus** (keyboard): `--focus-ring` 1px solid mint + 4px mint glow. Same rule for everything.
- **Disabled**: `opacity: 0.32`. No filter, no grayscale.
- **Composer focus**: input border shifts to `rgba(106,227,182,0.45)`. The caret stays.
- **Cursors**: use the default arrow across the popover, text cursor only in editable fields, pointer on buttons and links, and `not-allowed` on disabled controls.

### Layout rules

- Width is **504px by default** in the live popover. A custom root `layout.tsx` may set a wider explicit canvas, and the host resizes the popover to fit within the screen.
- **Height is auto.** The popover grows to fit. Plan layouts for any height between 220px and 720px. Once the popover reaches its max height, the popover body scrolls; the header and active agent-control surface stay pinned.
- The **composer** is pinned to the bottom on the main menu and idle agent surface; it is hidden while the settings view is open and replaced by the RunStrip while an agent run is in flight.
- The **SessionBar** is pinned just above the composer **only when** the agent has just added or undone something and is waiting for the user to decide.
- The **RunStrip** is pinned at the bottom **only while** an agent run is in flight, and it replaces both the composer and any SessionBar that might otherwise be shown.
- The popover never has horizontal scroll. Long file paths and names truncate with ellipsis.

### Card anatomy (widget)

A default-layout widget is a vertical stack inside the popover body, separated from its neighbors by a `1px dashed` divider - *not* a contained card.
A custom root `layout.tsx` may arrange widgets in another canvas, but each widget body should still avoid card-like containment.
Top to bottom:

1. **Head row** - tracked-caps `key` (e.g. `CLAUDE · WEEKLY`) on the left. The host does not render a generic per-widget manual refresh button; the app header owns full layout reload.
2. **Value row** — the big number (weight 300, 28–36px, tabular numerals, tight tracking) with the unit at small. Optional status word on the right.
3. **Progress** — a 1px line at `--ink-800` with a `--signal-live` fill plus a 3×5px head at the tip, like a tiny scanline. Optional.
4. **Foot row** - 11px ink-faint meta on the left (timestamp), an uppercase source tag on the right (`OAUTH`, `CLI`, etc).

Widgets do **not** have backgrounds, borders, shadows, or padding-as-containers. They use the popover canvas directly and rely on dividers for separation.

---

## Iconography

Type is the iconography. The system leans on **ASCII glyphs** and **tracked-caps words** instead of a drawn icon set.

1. **ASCII first.** `›` is the prompt and the menu-affordance pointer. `+` is add. `·` is separator. `↵` and `⌘` appear in shortcut hints. `●` is a status dot. These read crisp at any size because they are real characters in the body font (JetBrains Mono).
2. **Lucide for compact controls.** Use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) when ASCII won't carry a meaning, including `CircleArrowUp` for the update indicator, `Settings` for settings, and `Power` for quitting the app. Use **14×14** in compact controls and **16×16** in roomier controls, color `currentColor`. Lucide is the closest visual match - slightly soft, geometric, monoline - and is bundled with the live codebase.
3. **No emoji as UI.** No `🟢 / ✅ / ⚠️ / 🚫`. Status is the mint dot + word.
4. **No custom hand-drawn SVG.** The tray glyph is the wordmark's `b` rendered as a template PNG by `src/main/tray.ts`.

## Font substitutions

> **Flagged for the brand owner:**
>
> - **JetBrains Mono** (Google Fonts) — primary font for the entire popover and all preview cards. JetBrains Mono is on Google Fonts so the substitution is benign for production use; you can also self-host the woff2 from `https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/`.
> - **Inter Tight** (Google Fonts) — prose fallback for long copy (this README, card notes). Only used outside the popover surface.
>
> Both are loaded via `@import` from Google Fonts at the top of `colors_and_type.css`. **For production: replace the `@import` with `@font-face` declarations pointing at `fonts/*.woff2`.** If you'd prefer a different mono (Berkeley Mono, Commit Mono, Geist Mono), swap the value of `--font-mono` in one place and the whole system follows.

## Reading this system

A designer or agent picking this up:

1. Read this README top to bottom.
2. Open the Design System tab to flip through every token as a card.
3. Open `ui_kits/popup-menu/index.html` to see the popover live as a clickable prototype.
4. Cross-reference `src/ui/theme.css` for production widget values and `colors_and_type.css` for prototype values - never invent a new color.
5. Cross-reference the [live repo](https://github.com/vbasky/hatch) for ground truth on data shapes (`src/shared/contracts.ts`) and on extension/widget conventions (`extensions/AGENTS.md`).
