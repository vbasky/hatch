# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute.
One rule up front:

**Human-authored pull requests targeting `main` must be raised through [`no-mistakes`](https://github.com/kunchenguid/no-mistakes).**
We require this to reduce the maintainer's burden of reviewing and merging contributions.

`no-mistakes` puts a local git proxy in front of your real remote.
Pushing through it runs an AI-driven review, test, lint, and CI pipeline in an isolated worktree, forwards the push upstream only after every check passes, and opens a clean PR automatically.

A GitHub Actions check named `PR must be raised via no-mistakes` runs on PRs targeting `main` and fails if the body is missing the deterministic signature that no-mistakes writes, or if the structured pipeline attestation does not show `review`, `test`, and `document` as completed.
Known automation accounts are exempt so dependency and release automation can keep working.
Regular contributor PRs without the signature and attestation will not be reviewed or merged.

## Workflow

Fork routing requires `no-mistakes` v1.30.1 or newer.
This repository's required check also needs `no-mistakes` >= 1.46.0 so the PR body includes structured pipeline step attestation.

1. Fork the repo, then clone the parent repo or set your local `origin` back to the parent repo (`git@github.com:kunchenguid/hatch.git`).
2. Create a branch and make your changes.
3. Initialize or refresh the gate with your fork as the push target: `no-mistakes init --fork-url git@github.com:<you>/hatch.git`.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Push through the gate instead of pushing to `origin`: `git push no-mistakes`.
6. Run `no-mistakes` to attach to the pipeline, watch findings, and auto-fix or review as needed.
7. Once the pipeline passes, it pushes the branch to your fork and opens the PR against this repo for you.

See the [no-mistakes quick start](https://kunchenguid.github.io/no-mistakes/start-here/quick-start/) for the full first-run walkthrough.

## Repo Conventions

- Use `pnpm` with the pinned version from `packageManager`.
- Tests live in `tests/` at the repo root.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` before pushing.
- Run `pnpm generate:contracts` and commit `extensions/hatch-env.d.ts` after changing extension-facing types or `src/shared/extension-contract-names.ts`.
- Run `pnpm package:mac` when changing packaging, runtime paths, extension compilation, native dependencies, or release behavior.
- Local `pnpm package:mac` builds produce `Hatch.app` with bundle id `com.hatch.app`; they are ad-hoc signed and not notarized.
- Follow the universal native-dependency, build-only esbuild exclusion, and packaged runtime verification constraints in [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md#packaging).
- Keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` changes with dependency changes.
- Do not commit generated build output, release artifacts, runtime caches, or dev extension workspaces.
- Do not hand-edit release-please metadata such as `CHANGELOG.md` or `.release-please-manifest.json`.
- See `AGENTS.md` for architecture notes, extension workspace rules, and agent-specific constraints.

## Release Notes

Hatch releases are proposed by release-please after conventional commits land on `main`.
Use prefixes such as `feat:` and `fix:` so release-please can choose the version bump and release notes.
Mark breaking changes with `!` in the commit type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
Merging the release-please PR creates the version tag and a draft GitHub Release.
The release-please workflow builds the universal macOS app, signs every code object with `Developer ID Application: Kun Chen (9T2J7MNUP9)`, notarizes and staples the app and DMG, verifies the publication-ready DMG, computes its checksum, uploads it to the draft, and only then publishes the release before updating `kunchenguid/homebrew-tap`.
Any signing, notarization, verification, packaged runtime, checksum, or GitHub upload failure leaves the release as a draft and stops before stable publication and tap publication. A missing or invalid `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, or another tap update failure, occurs after stable publication and fails the workflow without updating Homebrew.
The generated Homebrew Cask quits Hatch during upgrade and relaunches it after installation only when the app was already running before uninstall started.

Maintainers must keep these repository secrets provisioned from the canonical secure owners:

- `MAC_DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_P12` - base64 of the password-protected Developer ID Application certificate and private key for Team `9T2J7MNUP9`.
- `MAC_DEVELOPER_ID_CERT_PASSWORD` - the p12 export password.
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_ID`, `APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID`, and `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY` - the App Store Connect API credentials used by `notarytool`; the API key is base64-encoded p8 content.
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` - write access to `kunchenguid/homebrew-tap` for the final cask update.

Never commit or print credential contents. Missing or malformed secrets fail the real release job; pull-request CI remains secret-free and validates the release config through `tests/release-config.test.ts`.
Maintainers must also keep the `HATCH_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` GitHub Actions repository variable configured for packaged-release telemetry; it is intentionally a variable rather than a secret because the id is baked into the app and sent in Umami payloads.

To release, merge the release-please PR and require the `release-please` workflow's macOS job to pass. The release remains a draft until the signed artifact passes verification and runtime E2E, receives a valid checksum, and uploads successfully. Do not upload a replacement DMG or update the tap by hand.
For the interrupted `0.1.23` release only, manually dispatch the `release-please` workflow from `main` with tag `hatch-v0.1.23` and version `0.1.23`. This recovery path builds the immutable workflow-dispatch SHA from `refs/heads/main` without moving the existing tag, requires that commit's package version to remain `0.1.23`, requires the GitHub Release to remain a draft, and reruns the normal signed, notarized, verified build and publish flow. It refuses a dispatch from another ref, any other tag or version, a checkout that differs from the dispatch commit, a mismatched package version, a missing or already-published release, or an uncertain GitHub query result. Normal releases continue building their immutable tags.
For a post-release check of exactly the downloaded artifact on macOS:

```sh
VERSION=x.y.z # Replace with the released version.
TAG="hatch-v${VERSION}"
mkdir -p verify-hatch/mount

gh release download "$TAG" --pattern "Hatch-${VERSION}-universal.dmg" --dir verify-hatch
DMG="$PWD/verify-hatch/Hatch-${VERSION}-universal.dmg"
hdiutil attach "$DMG" -readonly -nobrowse -mountpoint "$PWD/verify-hatch/mount"
trap 'hdiutil detach "$PWD/verify-hatch/mount" >/dev/null' EXIT
APP="$PWD/verify-hatch/mount/Hatch.app"

test "$(plutil -extract CFBundleIdentifier raw -o - "$APP/Contents/Info.plist")" = \
  "com.hatch.app"
test "$(plutil -extract CFBundleShortVersionString raw -o - "$APP/Contents/Info.plist")" = \
  "$VERSION"
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 "$APP"
SIGNATURE="$(codesign -d --verbose=4 "$APP" 2>&1)"
grep -Fq 'Identifier=com.hatch.app' <<<"$SIGNATURE"
grep -Fq 'TeamIdentifier=9T2J7MNUP9' <<<"$SIGNATURE"
grep -Fq 'Authority=Developer ID Application: Kun Chen (9T2J7MNUP9)' <<<"$SIGNATURE"
grep -Eq '^CodeDirectory .*flags=.*runtime' <<<"$SIGNATURE"
grep -Eq '^Timestamp=.+$' <<<"$SIGNATURE"
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 "$APP"
xcrun stapler validate "$APP"
xcrun stapler validate "$DMG"
lipo "$APP/Contents/MacOS/hatch" -verify_arch arm64 x86_64

hdiutil detach "$PWD/verify-hatch/mount"
trap - EXIT
```

The expected Gatekeeper result is `accepted` with source `Notarized Developer ID`. The workflow runs these checks, plus per-bundle and per-Mach-O identity, hardened-runtime, and timestamp checks, against the mounted publication-ready DMG before upload.
