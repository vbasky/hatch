# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for developing Hatch itself.
Embedded agents launched from Hatch should work from the active extension workspace and follow the copied `AGENTS.md` there for extension authoring.
`VISION.md` at the repo root is the project's acceptance policy; use its aligns/resisted tests when judging whether a change belongs here.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - runs `scripts/dev.mjs`, prepares a gitignored `extensions-dev/` workspace by copying `extensions/AGENTS.md`, `extensions/hatch-env.d.ts`, and `extensions/recipes/`, builds bundled ACP adapters into `out/adapters/`, builds the Node sidecar host, and runs `tauri dev`. The app itself sees current uncommitted changes, while the embedded agent is launched inside `extensions-dev/`.
- `pnpm dev:reset` - removes `extensions-dev/` and `.cache/hatch/acp-sessions`, recreates the dev workspace with the latest managed extension templates, and starts dev mode.
- `pnpm build` - build main, preload, renderer, and bundled ACP adapter bundles into `out/`.
- `pnpm generate:contracts` - regenerates `extensions/hatch-env.d.ts` (the `@hatch/contracts` surface) from `src/shared/contracts.ts`. Run after changing any extension-facing type or `src/shared/extension-contract-names.ts`, then commit the result; CI fails on a stale file.
- `pnpm package:mac` - cleans `release/`, builds the JS host and renderer, copies Tauri resources, and packages `release/mac-universal/Hatch.app` with bundle id `com.hatch.app`. Ad-hoc signed, not notarized. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the production release procedure.
- `pnpm dist:mac` - runs `package:mac` and creates `release/Baby-Menu-<version>-universal.dmg` from the dev bundle.
- `pnpm test` - run all Vitest tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e` - run only `tests/e2e-*.test.ts` (these include real `acpx/runtime` coverage against `acp-mock` plus bundled adapter coverage against fake local CLIs).
- `pnpm test:e2e:grok-popover` - run the unattended macOS Grok production-wiring check described in `docs/grok-quota-e2e.md`; it uses the real popover and exact consumer Grok usage source, requires a healthy local bearer, proves no refresh or auth mutation occurs, and never exposes auth or raw provider data.
- `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` - both run `tsc --noEmit` against `tsconfig.json`.
- Single test: `pnpm vitest run tests/<name>.test.ts` (or `pnpm vitest run -t "<name pattern>"`).

Use `pnpm` (declared `packageManager: pnpm@11.1.1`). Renderer dev server is pinned to port 5273 (`strictPort: true`).

### Packaging hygiene for automation (no-mistakes and other agents)

Agents running in `no-mistakes` worktrees (or any throwaway checkout) must not leave packaged macOS bundles behind.
A `release/mac-universal/*.app` left on disk gets auto-registered by macOS LaunchServices, and stale registrations make `open -a "Hatch"`, login items, and bundle-id launches resolve to the wrong build.
Follow these rules:

- If a packaged bundle is genuinely required, build it (it will carry the `com.hatch.app` identity), then delete the entire `release/` directory before the run finishes so nothing is left for LaunchServices to register.
- Never set a locally-built bundle as a macOS login item, and never install one into `/Applications`. The released app is delivered only through the Homebrew cask.

## Dev mode helpers

- `HATCH_KEEP_POPOVER_OPEN=1` disables the blur-to-hide behavior so the popover stays open while devtools / external windows have focus.
- `HATCH_OPEN_POPOVER_ON_START=1` opens the real popover through the tray bounds path for an explicit unattended check.
- `HATCH_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=<port>` enables Electron's loopback Chrome DevTools endpoint for an explicit unattended check; invalid ports are ignored.
- `HATCH_PACKAGED_TEST_HOME=<path>` isolates packaged-app state for the packaged runtime E2E; do not use it for normal app launches.
- `HATCH_AGENT=<agent-name>` overrides agent auto-detection when no saved Settings choice exists. E2E tests pass `acpx-mock` via `registryOverrides`.
- `HATCH_AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` overrides the embedded-agent request timeout.
- `HATCH_TELEMETRY=0` (or `false` / `off`) disables packaged-release telemetry; `HATCH_UMAMI_HOST` and `HATCH_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` override the self-hosted Umami target for telemetry testing.
- `process.env.VITEST` is checked in `src/main/host-entry.ts` so importing the sidecar entry from tests does not auto-start the host.

## Architecture

This is a macOS tray-bar app (Tauri 2 shell, Rust host, React renderer) whose distinguishing idea is that an embedded agent (running via `acpx/runtime`) edits the active extension workspace at runtime.
Tracked source extensions use git as the accept/rollback mechanism when selected explicitly; packaged mode edits `~/.hatch/extensions` and uses filesystem snapshots.

Three processes, kept deliberately separate:

1. **Main** (`src/main/`) - app lifecycle, tray, popover window, IPC, git, agent runtime. Never call agent or git from the renderer directly.
2. **Preload** (`src/preload/index.ts`) - the stable bridge. Exposes `window.hatch` via `contextBridge`. Do not add one-off preload methods for each widget.
3. **Renderer** (`src/renderer/`) - React UI: `AgentChat`, `WidgetHost`, custom popover layouts, `SettingsView`, `UpdateIndicator`, manual layout reloads, and app-shell controls such as Quit. Widgets, root `layout.tsx`, and extension settings sections should be hot reloadable and should not require an Electron restart for each new capability. The header reload control remounts only the menu surface so widget and root-layout discovery run again while the agent conversation and Settings state stay intact. The app shell and extension renderer surfaces share one design system, `@hatch/ui` (`src/ui/`); see "Design system" below.
4. **Extension server actions and background tasks** - privileged filesystem, shell, network, credential, token, storage, notification, and background work should live behind extension-owned `server.ts` modules.
   Renderer widgets call these actions with `window.hatch.capabilities.invoke(extensionId, action, input)`.
   Server actions live in the active extension workspace under `<extension-id>/server.ts` and export an `actions` object; background tasks export `background` from the same file.
   Do not add per-widget IPC channels or preload methods.

Shared types live in `src/shared/contracts.ts` - `HatchApi`, `HatchWidget`, `HatchSettingsSection`, `GitSessionSnapshot`, etc. The `Window.hatch` global is declared here.

The extension-facing slice of that contract is a generated public surface, treated like the preload bridge and `@hatch/ui` (see "Design system"). Extensions cannot see `src/shared/contracts.ts` (it lives inside the app bundle, not in the extension workspace), so the host ships those types into the workspace as the `@hatch/contracts` virtual module, declared in `extensions/hatch-env.d.ts`. That `.d.ts` is generated from `contracts.ts` by `scripts/generate-extension-dts.mjs` (run `pnpm generate:contracts`); the selected names live in `src/shared/extension-contract-names.ts`, and `HatchExtensionApi` is the window-bridge subset extensions may use. Do not hand-edit `extensions/hatch-env.d.ts`. After changing any extension-facing type in `contracts.ts`, or the name list, regenerate and commit the result - `tests/extension-contract-surface.test.ts` and the `ci.yml` "Verify generated contract types are up to date" step both fail on a stale file. Extensions import these types with a type-only `import ... from "@hatch/contracts"`, which the compiler erases and never validates against the runtime import allowlist; importing a value from that specifier is rejected. The committed `hatch-env.d.ts` is intentionally tracked (not release-only) because typecheck, `pnpm dev`, and packaging all read it. Never tell an extension or its agent to reach back into `../../src/shared/contracts`; that relative path resolves in source mode but does not exist in a packaged install, and chasing it is what previously sent the embedded agent scanning protected home-directory folders.

`src/main/` module index:

- `app.ts` - legacy host lifecycle, popover window creation, packaged path setup, extension seeding, preferences, selectable-agent catalog wiring, protocols, tray, and IPC. `package.json#main` points here via `out/main/index.js`.
- `app-paths.ts` - resolves source paths versus packaged `~/.hatch` paths.
- `tray.ts` - macOS tray icon and click handling (`createHatchTray`).
- `popover.ts` - popover `BrowserWindow` options (`createPopoverOptions`), adaptive width/height sizing (`responsivePopoverSize`), bounds math (`calculatePopoverBounds`), and renderer URL/file loading (`loadPopoverRenderer`).
- `ipc.ts` - registers all `ipcMain` handlers exposed via the preload bridge; the single place new generic IPC routes are added.
- `agent-catalog.ts` - defines built-in agents, parses custom `agents.json`, computes Settings availability, and builds `acpx` registry overrides.
- `agent-catalog-controller.ts` - owns the live agent catalog, validates Settings-added custom ACP agents, persists `agents.json`, and pushes refreshed registry overrides into the runtime without requiring an app restart.
- `agent-runtime.ts` - `HatchAgentRuntime` wrapping `acpx/runtime`; gates every `send()` through a change session, enriches pending-session snapshots with diff-derived change labels, preserves structured turn failures, and retries once after deleting a stale persisted ACP session that reports `SESSION_RESUME_REQUIRED`.
- `agent-turn-log.ts` - structured per-turn transcript log used by diagnostics and tests; failed turns include the runtime error message plus optional `code` and `detailCode`.
- `git-change-session.ts` - the tracked-source Save/Rollback safety boundary (see below).
- `dev-extension-change-session.ts` - the snapshot Save/Rollback boundary for gitignored dev and packaged extension workspaces.
- `extension-change.ts` - shared helpers that classify actual workspace diffs into created, updated, or removed extension/layout changes for the Keep/Undo UI.
- `extension-seeder.ts` - self-heals the packaged extension workspace from the bundled template on every launch: it force-copies the shipped defaults (`AGENTS.md`, `hatch-env.d.ts`, `recipes/`, and managed extensions) so a stale or edited managed file is restored, while leaving user-created extensions the template does not ship untouched (it never deletes them). If `~/.hatch/extensions` is a symlink, it copies into the resolved target without replacing the symlink, so home-manager `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` style writable targets work. Seeding failures are logged and skipped so tray startup can continue. Editing a managed default in `~/.hatch/extensions` therefore does not persist; change the source under `extensions/` instead.
- `extension-module-compiler.ts` - compiles extension widget, root layout, and server modules for production loading; rewrites the `react` and `@hatch/ui` imports to host protocol modules, rejects any other external import, and repairs content-addressed cache outputs that no longer match their authoritative extension source.
- `widget-tailwind-css.ts` - compiles widget and layout authored Tailwind utilities against the `@hatch/ui` `@theme` (single source of truth, `src/ui/theme.css`) for packaged loading, resolving symlinked source directories before copying them for Tailwind scanning.
- `widget-module-registry.ts` - discovers widget modules and the optional root `layout.tsx`, returning renderer `/@fs` URLs in dev and, in packaged mode, compiled `/__widgets__` module URLs plus sibling compiled `cssUrl` files; compiled layout failures warn and fall back to the built-in column.
- `widget-protocol.ts` - registers custom protocols for compiled widget and layout modules, their `.css`, and the renderer host shims (`react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, and `@hatch/ui` re-exported from the host global).
- `preferences.ts` - stores app preferences, including the selected agent, under the active app data root and applies login-item settings only when allowed. `app.ts` allows this only for the packaged production product named `Hatch`; source mode and packaged dev/test products are no-ops for macOS login items.
- `shell-path.ts` - expands `PATH` for GUI launches so packaged apps can find agent CLIs.
- `update-checker.ts` - checks the latest GitHub Release at most every 4 hours, compares it to the running app version, opens the release page externally, and simulates an available update in source/dev mode so the header indicator can be exercised.
- `recipe-loader.ts` - discovers and parses `recipes/*.html` from the active extension workspace.
- `server-action-registry.ts` - discovers extension server actions and background task declarations from the active extension workspace, caches unchanged compiled server modules, and reloads them when the entry or local helper source changes.
- `background-task-scheduler.ts` - runs discovered extension background tasks on host-owned timers, hot-reloads changed tasks, and enforces the 60-second minimum interval.
- `extension-database.ts` - owns the shared local SQLite database exposed to extension server actions, background tasks, and widgets through the bridge.
- `notifier.ts` - backs `context.notify` for server actions and background tasks with native notifications.
- `telemetry.ts` - anonymous, best-effort usage telemetry to a self-hosted Umami instance. One fire-and-forget POST per event or page view to `/api/send`, no user/device id and no prompt or file contents, every network error swallowed. The Umami host and website id are injected at build time by the `define` block in `electron.vite.config.ts` (CI release sets `HATCH_UMAMI_HOST` inline and reads `HATCH_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` from the `vars.*` Actions variable - not a secret, since the website id is sent in plaintext in every payload and baked into the shipped bundle); when unset (source/dev/test) the build website id is empty and the client is a no-op, so the app never phones home outside packaged release builds. `app.ts` initializes the default client, fires `app_start`, and records each popover open as both the `/popover` page view and the `popover_open` event; `agent-runtime.ts` fires `agent_turn` (status `success` / `error` / `timeout` / `blocked_dirty`) and `agent_switch`. Set `HATCH_TELEMETRY=0` (or `false`/`off`) to opt out, or override the target at runtime with `HATCH_UMAMI_HOST` / `HATCH_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`.

`src/adapters/` contains the bundled clean-room ACP adapters for built-in agents.
Claude Code and Codex are exposed to `acpx/runtime` as local adapter processes, while the adapters drive the real authenticated `claude` and `codex` CLIs in the active extension workspace.
The adapters intentionally run lean: they do not inherit user-level agent settings, skills, MCP servers, or extra rules.
The Codex adapter makes one narrow exception: because `--ignore-user-config` also discards the configured default model, it reads only the top-level `model` from `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` or `~/.codex/config.toml` and passes that value back as `--model`.

`src/renderer/` extension loading modules:

- `extension-modules.ts` - shared runtime loader for extension `widget.tsx` and root `layout.tsx` modules, including dynamic import and packaged-mode stylesheet injection for widgets, layouts, and settings sections.
- `settings/settings-sections.ts` - extracts `HatchSettingsSection` exports from loaded extension modules and sorts them by extension id for stable Settings page order.

### Build wiring

The renderer is built with Vite (`vite.config.ts`): `src/renderer/` -> `out/renderer/`. In dev the Tauri window loads the Vite dev server; in production it loads `out/renderer/index.html` from the embedded UI server.

`scripts/build-adapters.mjs` bundles `src/adapters/claude/index.ts` and `src/adapters/codex/index.ts` to `out/adapters/<name>/index.mjs` after `electron-vite build`.
`pnpm dev` runs the same adapter build before launching Electron because dev runtime paths also resolve adapters from `out/adapters/`.
Packaged builds keep `out/adapters/**` in `app.asar.unpacked` because adapter processes are spawned as standalone Node programs and cannot execute from inside `app.asar`.
See `docs/development.md#packaging` for the build-only `esbuild` boundary and its regression coverage.

`typescript` is intentionally externalized from the production main bundle because `extension-module-compiler.ts` imports it at runtime to compile packaged extensions.
Keep it in runtime dependencies unless that path changes.
`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and `postcss` are externalized for the same reason: `widget-tailwind-css.ts` runs Tailwind in the main process to compile widget and layout CSS in packaged mode, including workspaces whose `~/.hatch/extensions` path is a symlink.
Keep them in runtime dependencies, and keep the single pinned `postcss` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides`) so the Tailwind plugin and the processor share one version.
See `docs/development.md#packaging` for universal native-dependency and electron-builder constraints.
The renderer build adds `@tailwindcss/vite` and aliases `@hatch/ui` to `src/ui/index.ts` so dev-mode widgets resolve the design system directly.

### Design system (`@hatch/ui`)

`src/ui/` is a shadcn-derived component kit (Radix + Tailwind v4) restyled to the Monochrome Lab tokens, shared by the app shell and extension widgets.
`src/ui/theme.css` is the single `@theme` source of truth: it wipes Tailwind's default palette so only token colors exist, and it is consumed by both the renderer build (`src/ui/styles.css`) and the per-widget/layout compiler (imported `?raw` into the main bundle).
Delivery mirrors the React shim exactly: `main.tsx` installs the kit on `window.__HATCH_WIDGET_HOST__.ui`, `widget-protocol.ts` serves `hatch-host://ui/index.mjs` as a thin re-export, and the compiler rewrites the bare `@hatch/ui` specifier to that URL - so Radix, cva, and lucide stay inside the host bundle and never reach the widget import allowlist.
`src/shared/ui-exports.ts` is the public surface contract (treated like the preload bridge): the barrel, the contract list, and the generated host shim are kept in lockstep by `tests/ui-export-contract.test.ts`, so changing a public export is a deliberate, tested act.
Extension widgets, root layouts, and settings sections may additionally import only `@hatch/ui`; they author token-scoped Tailwind utilities, and their stylesheet is compiled and injected automatically.

`createPopoverOptions` enforces `frame:false`, `contextIsolation:true`, `nodeIntegration:false`, `skipTaskbar:true`, `alwaysOnTop:true`. Do not relax these without a reason.
On macOS, `app.ts` appends Chromium's `use-mock-keychain` switch before app readiness, so do not rely on Chromium or renderer storage for keychain-backed secrets.
Keep credential and token work in extension server actions.

### Agent runtime + change sessions

`HatchAgentRuntime` (`src/main/agent-runtime.ts`) wraps `acpx/runtime`. It allows only one active `send()` call at a time; overlapping sends return an "already running" assistant response before any change session begins. The active agent comes from the persisted Settings choice, then `HATCH_AGENT`, then catalog auto-detection. The catalog defaults to Claude Code and Codex, and may be extended by `agents.json` under the active app data root (`~/.hatch/agents.json` when packaged, repo-root `agents.json` in source mode). Built-in Claude Code and Codex entries are registered as `acpx` overrides that launch the bundled adapters, while availability still probes the wrapped local CLI (`claude` or `codex`). Settings can add, edit, and remove custom ACP agents by collecting a name, optional label, and launch command; those entries are persisted to `agents.json`, apply immediately through refreshed registry overrides, and remain editable/removable while built-ins stay read-only. Switching agents through Settings is blocked while an agent turn is running or while a change session can still be saved or rolled back; a successful switch closes the current persistent session with `discardPersistentState` so the next turn starts a fresh conversation.
Every accepted `send()` call:

1. Resolves the active extension workspace from runtime paths. Source mode honors `HATCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR` or defaults to `extensions/`; packaged mode uses `~/.hatch/extensions` after best-effort seeding of bundled templates, resolving a symlinked workspace target when present. Packaged Tailwind compilation also resolves symlinked source directories before scanning. Dev/source Tailwind utility generation scans only `extensions/` and `extensions-dev/` unless `src/ui/styles.css` or `src/ui/styles.dev.css` is given an additional `@source` path, so custom overrides outside those directories may load widget modules without their utility CSS.
2. Uses `DevExtensionChangeSession` for snapshot workspaces such as `extensions-dev/` and packaged `~/.hatch/extensions`, so Save keeps generated files, Rollback restores the pre-turn contents in place, and pending-session labels come from comparing the snapshot to the current workspace.
   Snapshot rollback must preserve a symlinked workspace node, restore files/directories/symlinks/binary contents/modes through that path, ignore and preserve existing user-owned `.git` metadata, and remove `.git` metadata that was created during the turn.
3. Uses `GitChangeSession.begin(rootDir, agentCwd)` only for the tracked source `extensions/` workspace when that workspace is selected explicitly. If the working tree is dirty, it short-circuits and returns a refusal message instead of running the agent - this is intentional; do not bypass it for tracked edits.
4. Lazily constructs the ACP runtime with `createFileSessionStore({ stateDir })` under `.cache/hatch/acp-sessions` in source mode or `~/.hatch/cache/acp-sessions` in packaged mode, with `permissionMode: "approve-all"`.
5. Uses a fixed `sessionKey: "hatch-agent-chat"` so the agent has a single persistent conversation.
6. If a failed turn returns `SESSION_RESUME_REQUIRED`, closes the runtime, removes `<stateDir>/sessions/hatch-agent-chat.json`, and retries the prompt once so bundled adapters that do not support `session/load` recover after an app restart.
   The failed attempt is still written to `.cache/hatch/agent-turns` with its error `message`, `code`, and `detailCode`; if the retry fails, the renderer surfaces the real thrown message instead of replacing it with a generic unavailable reason.

`GitChangeSession` (`src/main/git-change-session.ts`) is the safety boundary for Save/Rollback and maps changed git paths under the active extension workspace to extension ids or the root layout. Both operations refuse unless: the session started clean, the session is not already completed, and `HEAD` has not moved since the session began. `rollback()` runs `git reset --hard <recorded HEAD>` + `git clean -fd` - those destructive commands are only acceptable because of the preceding guards. Preserve this invariant.

After a successful turn, `HatchAgentRuntime` enriches the `GitSessionSnapshot` with `dirty` and `changes` from the actual workspace diff, never from the agent's prose.
If `dirty` is false, it silently saves/closes the active session so the renderer can say no files changed instead of offering a useless Keep/Rollback prompt.
A failed turn closes a clean session without showing that no-change message, while a dirty partial session remains available for Keep/Undo beside the failure guidance.
When files did change, the renderer summarizes one changed extension, multiple changed extensions, or a root `layout.tsx` edit for the Keep/Undo bar; clicking Keep clears the bar without showing a second kept confirmation.

Packaged runtime state lives under `~/.hatch` and is not git-backed.
Do not write generated extension files, the local extension database, compiled modules, preferences, logs, snapshots, or ACP session state into the `.app` bundle.

### Recipes and extensions

- Recipes are HTML files in `recipes/` inside the active extension workspace. `recipe-loader.ts` discovers `*.html`, sorts them, and extracts the title from `<title>` or first `<h1>`. They are intentionally HTML so the embedded agent can read them from its cwd and use embedded interactive demos.
- Bundled quota recipes currently cover Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Grok.
- Each recipe owns its provider-specific acquisition and refresh contract.
- Hatch ships a neutral extension platform, not opinionated third-party or provider widgets. The authoritative bundled default inventory is the `extensions` `extraResources` filter in `electron-builder.yml`; provider-specific widgets belong in user-installed extensions, never that inventory.
- Extensions live in the active extension workspace under `<extension-id>/` and may include `widget.tsx`, `server.ts`, and local helper files; the workspace may also include one root `layout.tsx` that arranges active widgets.
- Packaged widgets, root layouts, settings sections, and server actions are compiled into `~/.hatch/cache` and loaded through custom protocols or cached modules; dev mode keeps Vite `/@fs` loading for renderer modules.
- Root `layout.tsx` default-exports a `HatchLayout`, receives active widget metadata plus `renderWidget(id)`, owns the popover canvas arrangement, and lets the popover adapt to the canvas width plus chrome and the rendered height.
- Widgets conform to `HatchWidget` / `RefreshableHatchWidget`. The `WidgetHost` owns visible-widget refresh timing via `useViewRefresh`, using the main-process popover visibility signal - widgets should not start their own polling.
- Settings sections conform to `HatchSettingsSection`, are exported from `widget.tsx`, and own only the section body; `SettingsView` owns the frame and rediscovers sections when settings refresh or the popover reopens.
- New widgets and capabilities should be built as self-contained extensions behind the stable `window.hatch` bridge.
- Extension server actions and background tasks are discovered dynamically from the active extension workspace, so new or changed capabilities can be picked up without changing preload.
- Server action modules keep one module instance while `server.ts` and its local imports are unchanged, so module-scope state can survive repeated `invoke` calls and background ticks.
- That state is reset on code edits and app restarts; durable extension state belongs in the shared SQLite store, not module scope.
- Use `viewRefreshIntervalMs` / `refreshView` for live data that only matters while the popover is visible, and use background tasks only for work that must keep running while the popover is closed.
- Extension data that should persist locally belongs in the shared SQLite store, exposed as `context.db` server-side and `window.hatch.db` renderer-side; keep heavy queries out of widgets.
- The embedded agent should be steered toward editing its active extension workspace. The host core in `src-tauri/src/host/` (with the legacy `src/main/` dev host, `src/preload/`, and shared IPC wiring) is meant to be boring infrastructure.

### Recipe authoring best practices

- Recipes must be self-contained implementation specs.
- Do not tell the agent to inspect another repository, website, blog post, or external implementation guide before it can implement the recipe.
- It is fine to mention inspiration or provenance, but copy the actionable details into the recipe itself: commands, endpoints, local file paths, parser expectations, fallback order, security notes, IPC shape, files to edit, live verification steps, and acceptance criteria.
- A recipe should let an agent implement the feature from the recipe plus this repo alone.
- Each recipe should include a clear capability statement, expected user-facing behavior, recommended data-source order, implementation contract, error handling, security constraints, interactive demo, and acceptance criteria.
- For privileged work, explicitly say that filesystem, shell, network, credential, and token access belongs in extension-owned server actions behind `window.hatch.capabilities.invoke`.
- For durable local data, explicitly say whether the widget should read directly from `window.hatch.db`, whether a server action should use `context.db`, or whether a background task should persist data for later widget reads.
- For ongoing work, explicitly distinguish visible-widget refresh from background tasks and require the slowest acceptable interval.
- Renderer widgets and settings sections should receive normalized data over `window.hatch` and should not add new preload methods for each capability.
- If a real data source may be unavailable, require an explicit unavailable or sign-in-required result rather than a mock fallback; recipes should use real data only and must not fabricate or silently substitute mock data. Only specify labeled sample data when the user explicitly asks for examples.
- When a product-native client owns credential refresh or selection, a local expiry timestamp or raw API rejection is not proof of sign-out; require a bounded call through the authoritative client before showing sign-in guidance.
- Require generated live-data widgets to carry structured failures into accurate UI copy and keep last-good data visibly stale during refresh, launch, connectivity, rate-limit, service, and parser failures.
- Define normalized TypeScript shapes in the recipe so the agent knows what data extension server actions should return to widgets.
- Include parser guidance for command or API output, including timeout behavior, stale-data behavior, and user-visible errors.
- For recipes backed by live or system data, require the agent to inspect the real named source before writing parsing or rendering code, never guess field names or response shapes, and verify the finished server action or equivalent one-off check against the same live source before reporting done.
  Reasoning through return shapes on paper is not verification.
  If source inspection can expose secrets, require redacted output only.
- Never include or ask for committed secrets, tokens, cookie values, or local credential dumps.
- Standalone recipe HTML should use daisyUI from CDN and the `wireframe` theme.
- Include these tags in recipe HTML: `<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`, `<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@5/themes.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`, and `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>`.
- Set `<html data-theme="wireframe">` on recipe pages.
- Avoid custom `<style>` blocks in recipes unless there is a specific interaction that cannot be expressed with daisyUI and Tailwind utilities.
- Keep recipe typography readable: use a bounded content width such as `max-w-4xl`, body copy around `text-base`, comfortable `leading-7`, clear heading hierarchy, restored bullet and numbered list styles, and smaller text for code and tables.
- Prefer daisyUI components such as `card`, `table`, `btn`, `progress`, and `mockup-code` for recipe structure and demos instead of hand-written CSS.
- When changing recipe conventions, update `tests/recipe-loader.test.ts` so the convention is protected by regression tests.

## Conventions

- TDD is required for bug fixes and new features (skip only for docs / metadata / ephemeral artifacts). Tests live in `tests/` at the repo root, not co-located.
- TypeScript is strict; `moduleResolution: "Bundler"`, ESM (`"type": "module"`). Tests use Vitest with `vitest/globals` types.
- Never auto-add agent co-author lines to commit messages.
- Avoid em dashes; use plain `-`.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
